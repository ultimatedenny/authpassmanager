* Fix: Make sure files can only be opened once at the same time, even from different sources.
  (ie. prevent opening a copy of a file at the same time as the original)
* Fix: Synchronized saving of kdbx files - previously saving the same file twice at the same time
  could lead to corrupted database files.
* Desktop: copy with ctrl/cmd+c will now only copy selected text (if there is a selection, 
  otherwise copy full field).
